## Tools: I used Excel and its functions to perform cleaning, pivoting, analysis, and data visualization. 

## Analysis:

1- I wanted to know the sex ratio over the years

2- Distribution of sex ratio over sports

3- Age Distribution

4- Most countries that won medals

5- Number (trend) of summer and winter Olympics sports.

6- Frequency of medal-winning for individual players.

7- Count of medals across age categories and percentages of winning medals across ages.

8- Is there an association between the number of participants and the number of medal winnings for a particular country?

## Methods :

For data visualization and analysis I took advantage of Excel pivots and functions to perform data manipulation. I also used bar plots, line trends, histograms, and scatter plots.
